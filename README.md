This is my Github for my portion of the 484 Pinball project,

I used a 2" lcd from waveshare which uses an st7789 driver for our display.
The display lets the user know several things, such as: how to start the game, time remaining, how many balls are in play, score and when the game is over.

I used an off brand arduino to control the LCD, game logic and to read signals from the various tripwire sensors on the board.

disp&GameLogic contains the arduino code for my portion of the project.
